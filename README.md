Snake Game üêç
Snake Game is a classic arcade game developed using Python's Turtle module. In this game, the player controls the movement of a snake using the arrow keys. The objective is to guide the snake around the screen, eating food to grow in length while avoiding collisions with the walls and its own body.

Key features:

Dynamic Snake Movement: The snake moves continuously, with its head being controlled by the player through the arrow keys.

Food and Growth: Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer, making it more challenging to avoid collisions.

Score Tracking: The current score is displayed at the top of the screen and increases with every piece of food the snake consumes.

Game Over Conditions: The game ends when the snake's head collides with the wall or its own body, prompting a "Game Over" message.

This simple yet engaging game is a great project for understanding fundamental game development concepts in Python, such as handling user input, object movement, and collision detection.
